so i am learning react using a project
## problem 1
setting up the ide and local development environment
## problem 2
ignoring deprecation waarnings lol
### hack- i went straight to a project instead of running the default setting up of the dev environment because ruby was giving me challenges.

//different libraries are used to build react components and must be installed before development or building the app
e.g react navigation and stuff
